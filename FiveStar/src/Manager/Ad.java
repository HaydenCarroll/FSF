//(Andres R) This class is used to create the Ad objects that contain the data about the advertisements or other references 
//it should contain the name of the person/ad, the location/zone it is in (if a location is not passed is should default to online),
//how much the ad cost, how much has been sold as a result of the ad, and the number of customers that have used the ad
//be sure to have overloading instantiation methods for cases where variables are not passed.
//make a method that updates the the amount sold (ex. updateSoldAmnt(number) that equals amount sold+number)
//make a method that updates the number of customers that used the ad (ex. DEFAULT METHOD: updateAdUse() that equals ad use+1, METHOD: updateAdUse(number) that equals ad use+number)
//getters and setters
